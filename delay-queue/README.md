# Redis Delayed Queue - Implementation README

This code provides an implementation of a Redis Delayed Queue using the `go-redis` library in Golang. The implementation demonstrates how to create a delayed queue, add jobs to the queue with a specified delay, and process the jobs when their scheduled time arrives.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Golang is installed on your system.
- A Redis server is running on `localhost` with the default port `6379`.
- The `go-redis` package is installed. You can install it using the following command:

  ```
  go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v9
  ```

## Code Overview

The code can be divided into the following parts:

1. Setting up the Redis client: In the `main` function, a Redis client is created using the `redis.NewClient` function. The client is configured with the Redis server's address, password (if required), and database number.

2. Creating the delayed queue: The code specifies the name of the delayed queue and creates a goroutine to handle tasks in the delayed queue.

3. Handling tasks in the delayed queue: The goroutine continuously checks for tasks in the delayed queue. It retrieves the first task with a scheduled time that has already arrived, executes the task, and removes it from the queue.

4. Adding jobs to the queue: The code uses the `addJobToQueue` function to add jobs to the delayed queue. Each job is assigned a unique job ID and a specified delay time.

5. Executing jobs: When a job's scheduled time arrives, it is processed by executing the specific task logic associated with the job.

6. Closing the Redis connection: After all tasks have been processed, the Redis client connection is closed.

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Save the code to a file with a `.go` extension (e.g., `main.go`).

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code file.

3. Use the `go run` command to build and run the code:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

4. The code will add jobs to the Redis delayed queue and process them when their scheduled time arrives. Output messages will be displayed in the terminal indicating the execution of each job.

5. Wait for the code to finish processing all jobs. Afterward, the Redis connection will be closed, and the program will exit.

Note: Ensure that the Redis server is running before executing the code.

## Customization

You can customize the code according to your specific requirements:

- Adjust the Redis server connection settings in the `redis.NewClient` function call.
- Modify the delayed queue name and other relevant variables as needed.
- Customize the task logic inside the goroutine for job execution.
- Change the sleep time to control the frequency of polling the delayed queue.

Feel free to experiment with different configurations and logic to fit your application needs.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of implementing a Redis Delayed Queue using Golang and the `go-redis` library. By following the instructions and customizing the code, you can create a simple delayed queue system that schedules and executes jobs based on a specified delay.
